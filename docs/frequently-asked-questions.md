### **How does Gopher Industries manage communication among team members?**

Gopher Industries manages communication among team members with MS Teams, a collaborative communication platform. Here is how the company facilitates communication within the team:

- **Microsoft Teams (MS Teams):** Gopher Industries uses MS Teams as the primary communication tool. It provides a centralised space for team members to exchange messages, share files, hold meetings, and collaborate on projects.

- **Channels:** Within MS Teams, Gopher Industries creates different channels based on topics or projects. This helps organise discussions and keeps conversations relevant to specific areas, preventing information overload.

- **Direct Messages:** Team members can also communicate one-on-one through direct messages on MS Teams This allows for private discussions and quick exchanges of information between individuals.

- **Comms Leads:** Gopher Industries designates Comms Leads who are responsible for managing and overseeing communication channels. They ensure that important announcements, updates, and event information are shared with the team effectively.

- **Announcements and Updates:** Important announcements and updates related to projects, events, or company-wide initiatives are posted in designated channels. This ensures that all team members stay informed and are on the same page.

- **Meeting Scheduling:** MS Teams can be used to schedule and host virtual meetings, making it convenient for team members to collaborate regardless of their physical locations.

- **Document Sharing:** The platform allows for easy sharing of documents, files, and resources related to projects. This promotes seamless collaboration and ensures that all team members have access to the necessary information.

- **Integrations:** Gopher Industries may integrate other tools and apps into MS Teams to further enhance communication and collaboration. For instance, integrations with Trello or GitHub may streamline project management and code sharing.

- **Inclusive Communication:** Gopher Industries fosters an inclusive communication culture, where all team members are encouraged to participate and contribute their ideas and feedback. This promotes a sense of belonging and teamwork within the company.

### **What are Product Standup Meetings, and how often are they held?**

Product Standup Meetings are a type of regular team meeting held within Gopher Industries to facilitate coordination and progress updates for specific product development projects. These meetings are brief, focused, and typically held on a schedule. Each project team will meet once a week. There will be a team meeting one fortnight and then a sprint review with the company director the next fortnight. The times and days for the meetings for each project will be listed in the Meetings tab at the top of the Gopher Industries General channel.

Here is an overview of what Product Standup Meetings entail:

- **Purpose:** The main purpose of Product Standup Meetings is to keep the team informed about the progress of ongoing projects, identify any potential roadblocks or challenges, and ensure that everyone is aligned with the project's goals and tasks. These meetings also promote accountability and foster a sense of shared responsibility among team members.

- **Format:** Product Standup Meetings are usually short and time-boxed to ensure efficiency. The term "standup" comes from the practice of keeping the meeting participants standing to encourage brevity and focus. Each team member provides a brief update on their individual progress and what they plan to work on next.

- **Key Components:** During a typical Product Standup Meeting, team members cover the following key components:

  - *What I Did Yesterday:* Each team member shares a brief overview of the tasks they completed or the progress they made on the previous day.

  - *What I am Working on Today:* Team members outline the tasks they plan to work on during the current day or the specific goals they aim to achieve.

  - *Any Roadblocks or Issues:* If a team member is facing any challenges or roadblocks that may hinder their progress, they mention it during the meeting to seek assistance or support from the team.

  - *Coordination and Collaboration:* Standup Meetings provide an opportunity for team members to coordinate efforts, ask questions, and collaborate on tasks that may require joint efforts.

## **What happens if I cannot make a meeting?**

The fortnightly sprint review meetings with the company director will be recorded. The fortnightly team meetings will not. This is to allow an honest, open discussion. We understand not everyone will be able to make each meeting, so try to pick a project that you can make the most meetings. Otherwise, contact your project leader to gain an update and volunteer for some roles.

### **How do I track my contributions to capstone?**

You need to download the Worklog Excel template provided in the Files tab in the Gopher Industries General channel. Then record the date, duration, activity type and description of your contributions. Depending on the activities, it is advised you log 100-150 hours (depending on your target grade) to pass capstone units. If you need further assistance, reach out for help from the leadership team.

## **Do I get to pick what products I want to join?**

We encourage you to contribute across the board; not to work only for one product. To get involved in the product of interest, please reach out to the product backlog lead to express your interest and how you can contribute. There will be an expression of interest announcement during week 1/2 of the unit to track all student participation. 

### **What is the SCRUM framework, and how is it used in Gopher Industries' coordination process?**

Please refer to this link for a detailed explanation of a Scrum framework:
[https://www.scrum.org/learning-series/what-is-scrum](https://www.scrum.org/learning-series/what-is-scrum)

### **How are decisions made within Gopher Industries, and how can I provide input or feedback on projects?**

Product-based decisions are to be discussed with each product backlog lead, who in turn will seek advice and guidance from the acting company director. New product ideas can be proposed directly to the acting company director to determine validity before being adopted.

### **What networking opportunities are available for team members within the med-tech and health-tech industry?**

Networking opportunities are as follows:

-	INNOFEST event organised annually by the Capstone committee and held at the Deakin Downtown every Trimester 2.
-	Products that are collaborating with industrial partners.

### **What happens if I encounter challenges or conflicts within the team? Is there a process to address such issues?**

We encourage a collaborative environment within the company and each project team. If you encounter challenges or conflicts with individuals in a product team or in the company, please reach out to the leadership team first to attempt to resolve the matter. However, if the issue involves plagiarism, unethical conduct or actions that break the laws of the land, it should be brought to the attention of the acting director or Unit chair immediately.

### **Can I collaborate with students from other teams or faculties within Deakin University on Gopher projects?**

You are encouraged to collaborate with other students or teams or faculties within Deakin University to seek help or guidance in accomplishing the task/s that you are allocated to. In the Capstone unit, you can also reach out to other student cohorts to discuss and collaborate.

### **How can I seek help or ask questions if I need assistance?**

If you have specific company questions, try posting on the Gopher Industries general channel. Otherwise, contact one of the 3Cs leaders, any leadership members, or the acting director. For more unit-specific questions, it is advised to contact your unit coordinator.
