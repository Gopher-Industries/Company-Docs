# Project Overview 

NutriHelp aims to promote healthy eating habits for Australia's senior
population, by providing personalised recipes based on the user's
specified health conditions and nutritional preferences. Our goal is to
decrease the number of elderly people that are either malnourished or at
risk of malnutrition, promote nutritional health through food intake and
increase transparency and awareness of our user’s current nutritional
health.  

NutriHelp facilitates this by allowing the user to input their
nutritional preferences and health information such as their allergies,
health conditions, and common dietary requirements, the application can
then automatically generate daily recipes specific to these
inputs. Additionally, NutriHelp allows users to scan the labels of
products in their supermarket or at home to check if the product
contains any user-specified allergens or ingredients that align with a
user’s health conditions.

The user can track their nutritional health whilst enabling family
members and/or carers and a GP to receive health reports to monitor the
user. Key things to understand that differentiate us from competitor
applications are: 

Our application is largely designed for seniors; thus, we must consider
accessibility, technological limitations, and disabilities. 

Our application is focused on supporting our user’s nutrient-related
diseases, nutritional deficiencies, and allergies. This is a core
challenge for our application. A simple example of our application at
work is supporting a user with a Vitamin B6 deficiency by providing
recipes rich in B6.  

Providing capability for family members/carers to monitor and receive
reports regarding the user’s health. Further exploration planned around
health practitioner integration. 

Future integration with other applications within Gopher Industries. 

The current key end-deliverables for this project are a react based web
application and a mobile application.

Trimester 3 has been focused on developing the web application and the
firebase backend of the project.

# Open Issues 

*Here are some examples of Open Issues:*

- *Software compatibility issues that arise when members of the team use
  different version of software.*
- *An unclear process for reviewing completed tasks on Trello, leading
  to a backlog of work that is sitting somewhere between unfinished and
  finished.*
- *An essential team member had to leave the team with no notice, and
  there is currently a skill void in their place.*

Some of the issues and challenges faced were:

1.  Some members who were on- boarded needed awareness on how to clone
    repositories on Git-Hub and work on the front-end development.

*\*The lack of awareness on the use of Git-Hub was addressed by
interactive workshops conducted by Senior members (Mr Peter & Mr Bowen)
of Capstone to highlight the essential steps and codes needed to
implement/commit/push changes into the master branch.*

2.  Members needed guidance on how to take up tasks on the Trello card
    and how to move the cards for code review and done section.

*\* Product lead (Mr Peter) discussed about the use of Trello boards
during Stand-Up meetings on Teams. Members were assigned cards from the
Product backlog and were guided on how to move the cards from To-Do-List
to code review.*

3.  While the pulls requests were made on Git-Hub, there were issues or
    conflicts while merging the changes into the master branch.

*\*Product leads helped in reviewing and fixing the bugs so that the
commits/changes could be merged into the master branch*

4.  There was no database for the Nutri-Help

*\*Product lead Mr John was able to create an informative database for
Nutri-Help during one of the sprints.*

# Lessons Learned 

**Lesson 1: Effective Communication and Participation in Stand-Up
Meetings:**

\- In our project, we learned that regular and active participation in
Stand-Up meetings is crucial for team members. This facilitates the
assignment of relevant tasks from the Trello board and allows for
continuous monitoring of the progress of product development. It ensures
that team members are aligned, aware of each other's contributions, and
can address any roadblocks promptly.

**Lesson 2: Importance of Upskilling Workshops, Especially on Git-Hub
Usage:**

\- We found that participation in Upskilling workshops conducted by
senior team members is vital, particularly for those who need awareness
on tools like Git-Hub. Lack of proficiency in such platforms can hinder
collaboration and version control. Investing time in workshops can
significantly enhance the team's efficiency and cohesion.

**Lesson 3: Recording Stand-Up Meetings and Workshops for Future
Reference:**

\- To address the challenge of information retention, we discovered that
recording Stand-Up meetings and interactive Upskilling workshops
(covering tools like Figma, wireframe diagrams, and React) is
beneficial. This allows team members to revisit discussions and learning
sessions, enabling them to catch up on missed information and stay
informed for future sprints.

In terms of the specific project challenges faced:

**1. Storing User Profile Information:**

\- Future teams should implement a robust system for storing user
profile information from the profile page. This may involve utilizing a
secure database and ensuring synchronization with the application's
overall architecture.

**2. Syncing Navigation Bars on Landing Page:**

\- To avoid discrepancies, teams should establish a clear protocol for
syncing navigation bars when creating new ones. This may involve regular
checks and coordination among team members responsible for design and
development.

**3. Effective Handover Dates:**

\- To enhance project continuity, future teams should establish clear
handover dates and procedures. This ensures a smooth transition between
phases and minimizes disruptions caused by changes in team composition.

**4. Consistency in Design Across Contributors:**

\- Teams should implement a design review process to ensure consistency
across contributors' designs. This involves regular check-ins,
collaborative design sessions, and adherence to a standardized design
system.

**5. Optimizing Work Distribution:**

\- Reflecting on our experience, optimizing work distribution is
crucial. Future teams should carefully assess team members' strengths
and allocate tasks accordingly. Regularly revisiting and adjusting work
distribution based on individual and team performance is key.

**6. Enhancing Communication Frequency:**

\- While our communication was satisfactory, we acknowledge that
increasing its frequency would be beneficial. Future teams should
emphasize regular updates, possibly through additional communication
channels or more frequent Stand-Up meetings, to foster a more dynamic
and informed team environment.

In conclusion, these lessons, and recommendations stem from our
experiences with the Nutri Help project this trimester. Implementing
these changes will likely contribute to more efficient collaboration,
enhanced skill development, and smoother project execution for future
teams.

# Product Development Life Cycle

## New Tasks 

**How are new tasks created?**

- New tasks are created during the Stand-Up/Retrospective meetings on
  teams.
- Tasks are written on the Product Backlog by the Product leaders on
  Trello Board.
- Members are assigned a task, and each Sprint is carried out during the
  week.
- Product lead moves the card from Doing to done once a member has
  finished with the task and has created a Pull Request on the Gopher
  Industries Git-Hub.

***How does your team form new ideas about work that needs to be done
and turn those ideas into distinct, actionable tasks?***

- New ideas are formed during the Stand-Up/Retrospective meetings on
  teams every Sunday at 7pm.
- Team members are asked to give their ideas on how to improve the
  product.
- Product lead logs the task needed to be done on the product Backlog as
  a Sprint.
- Product lead assigns each member with a card which can be completed by
  the end of the week.
- Upon completion of the task, the member creates a pull request on
  Git-Hub which must be reviewed by at least two members before it can
  be approved and merged into the main company branch.
- Once the Pull Request is approved and merged, the Product lead moves
  the card to done on Trello board.

## Definition of Done 

**How does the team know when a task is done?**

The team considers a task complete when all its specified objectives are
achieved, including coding, testing, documentation, and code reviews.
The Trello card representing the task is then moved to the "Done"
section, providing a visual cue for the entire team, ensuring
transparency, and celebrating progress.

**What are criteria for a successfully completed task?**

A task is successfully completed when the code receives approval through
a GitHub pull request, validated by the GitHub lead. Documentation is
then verified by product leads before moving the Trello card to the
"Done" section, signifying completion, and ensuring alignment with
project standards.

**This may seem obvious, but it in a software development project having
a definition of done can ensure a certain standard of work that holds
all team members accountable. For example, messy, clunky code that “just
works” is very different to clean, well-commented code that works AND is
easy to understand. Which would you prefer to be your team’s definition
of done?**

The team's definition of done, which emphasises clear, well-commented
code that is both functional and understandable, is the one I would
rather choose. This guarantees a better quality of work, encourages
maintainability of the code, and makes teamwork easier. A thorough
definition of done that considers documentation, readability, and code
quality helps maintain a uniform standard throughout the project,
improving the overall quality of the software and its long-term
viability.

## Task Review 

***Who reviews a task once it’s been marked as done?***

The product leads or any other member reviews the task or code once a
pull request is made by members in Git-Hub. Hence the pull request is
approved once the reviewer has verified the code with the master branch.

***How does the team ensure that all work is looked over before it’s
contributed to the main repository or working prototype?***

The code in the pull request in Git-Hub are checked thoroughly to avoid
any conflicts with the master branch and then later merged into the main
branch.

## Testing 

**How do you test your product to see if it does what it was originally
planned to do?**

The product leads or the member who had made the commit/push requests in
Git-Hub runs the code on the product website to ensure that it gives the
necessary outputs. For example, the creation of the Recipe search
function can be tested by logging into the Nutri-Help website and seeing
that it takes the user to the Recipe page once the Recipe search button
is used.

**If your product isn’t heavily comprised of software, how can you build
in testing to your team’s product development life cycle to ensure that
“stuff works as it should”?**

Product leads meet with other members during Scrum/Stand-Up meetings to
review different aspects of the software including quality,
functionality and stability. Members can discuss the overall performance
and tools needed to make testing more efficient.

## Branching Strategy 

**How does your team currently use GitHub repository?**

- Members are asked to create a branch from the master branch.
- Members clone their repository to create a local copy on their
  computer.
- They make changes in their own remote repositories and then
  commit/push the changes into the main branch followed by a pull
  request.

**What rules for commits and pull-requests have been put in place so
far?**

- A member can only commit changes if it includes a relevant/required
  new feature.
- The pull request needs to be approved by at least two members before
  it can be merged into the main branch**.**

**How should new members use GitHub repository in a way that doesn’t
result in all commits being dumped in a messy Master branch?**

New members must inform the Product leads once they have made the pull
requests so that it can be approved and then later merged into the main
branch.

**Again, if your team hasn’t formally discussed a branching strategy,
this a great opportunity to describe what your current system is and how
it could be improved going forward.**

Our team has formally discussed and agreed on the branching strategy for
making commits in the Git-Hub. However, it can be improved if members
can have a separate branch for committing each feature so that it is
clear for reviewing before it can be merged.

**For example, if you currently have all members of the team commit
directly to the Master branch, can you recommend any tutorials for the
future team to review that might lead to a cleaner, more organised, and
more efficient repository?**

Recommendation: Members can be asked to make a new commit only when
their previous commit and pull requests have been approved. Hence this
will avoid commits being dumped in a Messy Master branch.

# Product Architecture 

## UML Diagram

<img src="https://github.com/Gopher-Industries/Company-Docs/blob/master/handover/nutrihelp/T3%202023%20imgs/UML.png" style="width:7.14236in;height:4.375in" />
The diagram below defines the navigational flow of the NutriHelp web app
from the user’s perspective.

## Tech Stack 

**ReactJS:** The JavaScript library used to build user interfaces and
general components for front-end development. We chose ReactJS for its
efficiency in updating and rendering components, its strong community
support, and its flexibility in integrating with other libraries or
frameworks.

**HTML/CSS:** Essential technologies used to define the structure of web
pages (HTML) and style them (CSS). These were chosen for their
universality in web development, ease of use, and wide support across
all web browsers, making them ideal for creating responsive and visually
appealing interfaces.

**Google Firebase:** The platform used to store data, including user
logins via Google or email/password authentication, and various user
data like recipes. Firebase was selected for its real-time database,
seamless integration with web and mobile applications, and robust
security features, which simplify the backend development process.

**DialogFlow ES:** A platform for training chatbots, using natural
language processing to understand user queries. It was chosen for its
advanced AI capabilities, ease of integration with various platforms,
and the ability to create conversational experiences that are natural
and intuitive for users.

**Kommunicate:** The platform to host the chatbot, providing tools for
automating customer support and engagement. It was selected for its ease
of integration with DialogFlow, robust analytics to track user
engagement, and customizable chat interface to match the look and feel
of our application.

# Source Code 

**GitHub:** <https://github.com/Gopher-Industries/Nutrihelp>

To facilitate development, all developers will need to create their own
branch from the repository, then perform pull requests after having made
changes. Limit each commit to one feature or modification to the
codebase. Only the Leads should have write-access to the repository to
approve pull requests. Please contact your mentor for access and specify
who you want to be the administrator for the team.

**Wireframe Maps:**

This chart defines the navigation flow of the NutriHelp web app from the
user’s perspective, for which the design and development of the app is
based on.

# Login Credentials 

**Google Firebase config keys (from *web-frontend -\> src -\> utils -\>
firebase.js*):**

// Your web app's Firebase configuration

>> const firebaseConfig = {  
>>  apiKey: "<API>",  
>>  authDomain: "nutrihelp-39346.firebaseapp.com",  
>>  projectId: "nutrihelp-39346",  
>>  storageBucket: "nutrihelp-39346.appspot.com",  
>>  messagingSenderId: "127254846668",  
>>  appId: "1:<API>:web:<API>"  
>> };

These keys are used to access the Google Firebase database, but new ones
should be created for the Google account relevant to the trimester of
work so that access to the Google Firebase GUI could be achieved for
full control of the database.

**Kommunicate config keys (from *web-frontend -\> src -\> App.js*):**

>>  useEffect(() =\> {  
>>    (function (d, m) {  
>>    var kommunicateSettings =  
>>      { "appId": "<API>", "popupWidget": true,  
>>      "automaticChatOpenOnNavigation": true };  
>>      var s = document.createElement("script"); s.type = "text/javascript";  
>>      s.async = true;  
>>      s.src = "https://widget.kommunicate.io/v2/kommunicate.app";  
>>      var h = document.getElementsByTagName("head")\[0\]; h.appendChild(s);  
>>      window.kommunicate = m; m.\_globals = kommunicateSettings;  
>>    })(document, window.kommunicate || {});  
>>  }, \[\]); // Empty dependency array ensures this runs only once after component mount  

These keys are used to link with the NutriHelp chatbot hosted by
Kommunicate, but new ones should be created for the Google account
relevant to the trimester of work as this is a Kommunicate trial key and
is rendered inactive after the trial ends.

# Other Relevant Information 

**Training the ChatBot and integrating it to the web app**

DialogFlow ES is the platform that is used to train the NutriHelp
chatbot.

<img src="https://github.com/Gopher-Industries/Company-Docs/blob/master/handover/nutrihelp/T3%202023%20imgs/Training%20Bot1.png" style="width:6.15466in;height:2.62153in" />
Each intent represents a set of prompts from the user and associated
responses from the chatbot. Each intent can be extended by a
“Follow-Up”, such as a “Yes”, a “No”, or a customised one. All *intents*
and *follow-ups* are customisable.

<img src="https://github.com/Gopher-Industries/Company-Docs/blob/master/handover/nutrihelp/T3%202023%20imgs/Training%20Bot2a.png" style="width:6.22569in;height:2.52893in"
alt="A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated" />
After training the chatbot with DialogFlow ES, to integrate the chatbot with
the web app, open the Google Cloud Platform and create a service key
(file extension .json) for the DialogFLow ES project. Download the
service key.

<img src="https://github.com/Gopher-Industries/Company-Docs/blob/master/handover/nutrihelp/T3%202023%20imgs/Training%20Bot3.png" style="width:6.23958in;height:2.58542in"
alt="A screenshot of a chat Description automatically generated" />
Create a Kommunicate account, then add a bot to the account and link the
service key (file extension.json) to it via the *Bot Integration*
section.

Extrapolate the Kommunicate config keys (example below) and paste it
onto App.js.

>>  useEffect(() =\> {  
>>    (function (d, m) {  
>>      var kommunicateSettings =  
>>        { "appId": "<API>", "popupWidget": true,  
>>          "automaticChatOpenOnNavigation": true };  
>>          var s = document.createElement("script"); s.type = "text/javascript";  
>>          s.async = true;  
>>          s.src = "https://widget.kommunicate.io/v2/kommunicate.app";  
>>          var h = document.getElementsByTagName("head")\[0\]; h.appendChild(s);  
>>          window.kommunicate = m; m.\_globals = kommunicateSettings;  
>>        })(document, window.kommunicate || {});  
>>    }, \[\]); // Empty dependency array ensures this runs only once after component mount
