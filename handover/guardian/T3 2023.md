## Project Information

### Company Acting Director

- **Name:** Dr. Bahareh Nakisa
- **Title:** Lecturer, Applied Artificial Intelligence
- **Email:** <bahar.nakisa@deakin.edu.au>

### Project Team

- **Project Name:** Guardian Monitor
- **Company:** Gopher Industries

## Project Overview

Guardians is an activity monitoring and profiling system for the aged care sector with plans to
expand to residential homes. Guardians uses non-invasive radar technology to record a user's
activity and classify these activities over time. Guardians utilises the classified data to predict
possible physical and mental health conditions associated with that behaviour.

The goal of the project is to alert the patient's carer and/or health professional to unusual
changes in monitored behaviour. The key features of Guardian are:

- Detecting patients falling over and alerting the carer. 
- Patient profile capture, edit and search.
- Monitoring and profiling patient activities.
- Alerting caregivers and supervisors during an emergency.
- Predicting potential physical and mental health conditions at an early stage.
- Providing suggestions to see a health professional based on health issues detected.
- Encouraging positive activities.
- Generating weekly and monthly activity dashboards.
- Providing access to accurate real-time visualisation and patient position(s).
- Ability to define a baseline for a patient.
- User management allows for defining Patient, Carer, and Admin users.

## User Manual

1. Launch app via Android Studio on a physical device or in the emulator
2. Press the **Get Started** button in the first screen to enter the login screen
3. Register a new User via the Register screen
4. After you receive the email verification link to your Email address, click the link to confirm your user is verified
5. Login using your email address and password. Choose a role.

## Completed Deliverables

### Auto-login Enhancement

- Enabled auto-login with fixes to avoid requiring the user to re-login when the app is minimized.

### Nurse User Implementation

- Allow login as a nurse user.
- Nurse user homepage.
- Nurse user task list.
- Implement Caretaker profile screen.

### Login and Registration Improvements

- Enabled Google Sign-in support.
- Enforced password confirmation on registration.
- Enforced stronger password standards.
- Enforced email validation for new users.

### Patient Management

- Added a "Add Patient" button in the Patient list and on the add new patient screen.
- Implemented swipe-to-delete functionality for patients in the patient list with delete confirmation.
- Archived patient list – view list of recently deleted patients.
- Animated patient status icon in the patient list.
- Heart rate data entry and chart visualization with app-themed chart styling and navigation from the patient medical diagnostics screen.

### UI Improvements

- Redesigned Caretaker homepage.
- Improved Theme control switch on the Settings screen.
- Removed Arrow icons on the Settings screen, which imply navigation to another screen.
- Updated placeholder text on the Welcome screen with text meaningful to the Guardian application.
- Added Role-specific welcome text on each homepage.
- Fixed the issue where the hamburger sidebar menu only works on the patient list screen.

### Code Quality and DevOps

- Implemented a pipeline to build, test, and lint the app.
- Fixed ~45 Android lint errors and ~500 Android lint warnings.
- Migrated about 44.8% of the codebase from Java to Kotlin.
- Replaced hardcoded UI strings with translatable string resources.
- Removed useless test file in the repo (newtestfile.txt).
- Replaced the placeholder project package name with one specific to Guardian.
- Added a License file to the repo.

### Documentation

- Documented password strength requirements for health applications.
- Documented self-hosted backend security standards.
- Documented database security requirements and legislation for health apps.

##  AI system
To accomplish the goals surrounding patient activities and event detection, Guardian will employ sensors that pass real-time signals to an AI-driven system. This AI system will process the signalling data to infer an output with respect to Human Activity Recognition (HAR). This output will be fed into Guardian's database, allowing patient activity to be accessible by the app's users. 

Employing AI systems introduces a large logistical challenge because of the large amount of preparatory work. In short, the final model will be derived from a ‘prerequisite model’, which itself needs to be preceded by the stages Data Familiarisation, Input Preprocessing, Feature Extraction for it to be effective. Each stage itself also has many considerations. Details of these have their own sections.

   - Complete the nurse user feature set.

4. **Theming Update**
   - Update theming to match the Caretaker profile color palette (darker blue, flat icons).

5. **Google Sign-In Integration**
   - Integrate backend with Google Sign-In (enable in Firebase Authentication service).

6. **Database Integration**
   - Integrate database with heart rate data.
   - Integrate database with the patient archive list.
   - Integrate database with the nurse task list, allowing nurses to be assigned tasks by admins.

7. **Self-Hosted Backend Connection**
   - Allow application users to optionally connect to a self-hosted backend within the app.

8. **Security Implementation**
   - Implement documented security recommendations.

## Open Issues

See [Trello Backlog](https://trello.com/b/jszQMoj0/major-product-1-guardian-monitor)

## Lessons Learned

This trimester the Guardian team faced delays whilst being unable to gain access to the Firebase Admin console.
In future, project teams should:

1. Request Firebase access early to ensure there are no delays that would limit backend work.
2. Continue investigating self-hosted backend options which are compatible with Firebase.
3. Ensure that contributions Guardian, regardless of their focus, store all their documentation in the same  

## Product Development Life Cycle

1. Use a simple branching strategy where a branch is raised for each task and a pull request is raised back to the master branch.
2. PRs should be reviewed by a team leader who is experienced in the area of development. Feedback should be given for improvements and applied.
3. Once approved by a reviewer, the PR can be merged if the CI run passes and there's no conflicts.

## New Tasks

Tasks can be created on the trello board by any team member.
Team member's are encouraged to create new tasks if they find bugs to be fixed, or have ideas for improvements.

## Definition of Done

When it is reviewed and tested. It must fulfill the specification of the Trello task. 

In terms of the AI system 

## Task Review

Completed tasks will be reviewed by the project lead, or another member experienced with the task's domain. 

In terms of reviewing tasks related to the AI pipeline, it is often unclear whether a component is sufficient or 'complete' before it is integrated with the subsequent components. Therefore, after an internal review, an AI consultant will need to verify 
the integrity of the a task or component. If the tasks are code oriented, members must provide clear comments. 

## Testing

1. Unit tests to validate the functionality of pure Kotlin and Java code (not Android specific)
2. Instrumented UI tests to validate UI behaviour
3. Manual tests
4. In terms of the AI development, quoting a high evaluation metric does not justify a prototype model 'passing the test'. Members must verify with peers to make sure that generalisation considerations are not missed. 

## Branching Strategy

A simple workflow is followed where tasks are completed in each developer's project fork.
After that a PR is raised to merge changes into the master branch of the primary Guardian repository.

## Product Architecture

### UML Diagram

## Login Credentials

For the Android application to run locally, each developer must add an API key to the `google-services.json` file. **These credentials must not be committed to the repo**

These credentials can be found [In Microsoft Teams](https://deakin365.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/GopherIndustries2/Shared%20Documents/Guardian%20Weekly%20Meeting%20Channel/Credentials?csf=1&web=1&e=m5czYz)
