## Project Overview

Guardian is an activity monitoring and profiling system for the aged care sector with plans to
expand to residential homes. Guardians uses non-invasive radar technology to record a user's
activity and classify these activities over time. Guardians utilises the classified data to predict
possible physical and mental health conditions associated with that behaviour.

The Guardian Monitor's key features are:

1. Live updating of patient current activity.
2. Alerting the carer or nurse if a patient falls.
3. Having a profiling system to capture, edit and search patients.
4. Allowing each user to define the patient, carer and Admin users.
5. Generating dashboards about patient activity history.
6. Detecting changes in patients' physical health to suggest referrals.

Guardian's backend integrates an AI-driven system to facilitate the proposed features. This system can be thought as a pipeline, which terminates with a classification model that outputs the patient's activity in real-time. Such activities include, standing, sitting, lying down and more (exact activities not confirmed yet). This pipeline's architecture takes inspiration from several modern and cutting-edge publications in the research landscape that integrates Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and Machine Learning (ML). This emergent research area that has already demonstrated remarkable results. Our Guardian Monitor will too, spearhead the modern standards of HAR for healthcare with our powerful AI-driven system.

- Added a "Add Patient" button in the Patient list and on the add new patient screen.
- Implemented swipe-to-delete functionality for patients in the patient list with delete confirmation.
- Archived patient list â€“ view list of recently deleted patients.
- Animated patient status icon in the patient list.
- Heart rate data entry and chart visualization with app-themed chart styling and navigation from the patient medical diagnostics screen.

### UI Improvements

- Redesigned Caretaker homepage.
- Improved Theme control switch on the Settings screen.
- Removed Arrow icons on the Settings screen, which imply navigation to another screen.
- Updated placeholder text on the Welcome screen with text meaningful to the Guardian application.
- Added Role-specific welcome text on each homepage.
- Fixed the issue where the hamburger sidebar menu only works on the patient list screen.

### Code Quality and DevOps

- Implemented a pipeline to build, test, and lint the app.
- Fixed ~45 Android lint errors and ~500 Android lint warnings.
- Migrated about 44.8% of the codebase from Java to Kotlin.
- Replaced hardcoded UI strings with translatable string resources.
- Removed useless test file in the repo (newtestfile.txt).
- Replaced the placeholder project package name with one specific to Guardian.
- Added a License file to the repo.

### Documentation

- Documented password strength requirements for health applications.
- Documented self-hosted backend security standards.
- Documented database security requirements and legislation for health apps.

##  AI-driven System

At the time of writing (end of T3 2023), **Guardian's AI engineers are to focus on tasks that lead up to key feature ONE**:
1. Live updating of patient current activity 
   
From the AI or ML perspective, no plans or progress have been made on any of the other key features.

The ML-oriented instructions for key feature ONE will be detailed in the subsections below. 

### AI Pipeline's Logistics
Our AI-driven system presents a logistical challenge from the large amount of preliminary work. In short here is the logic and process if we work backwards from its successful implemention:
* The app knows the patient's real-time activity because it gets this data from the backend.
* The backend knows the patient's real-time activity because it is integrated with an AI pipeline.
* This AI pipeline's input is the raw signalling states from the sensors and its output is the activity. This pipeline is constantly receiving real-time streams of signalling states while also constantly giving real-time updates on the current activity. This means that while we are engineering the system, we need to make sure the latency (processing times) remains low.

At this point, the question to ask and answer is: "How does the AI pipeline learn the pattern that maps 'signal' to 'activity'?"
* We can't expect a pipeline or model to learn the real-time data "on the spot". 
* The activity classification model at the end of this pipeline is to be derived or refined from a **pretrained model**. 
* This pretrained model should be considered in the context of its **offline pipeline** 
* The components of the offline pipeline (in order are): **Data Preprocessing**, **Feature Extraction** and **Classification Model**.
This offline pipeline is where we are currently up to.

### Data Familiarisation 
*The above stages and components require at least a high-level understanding of the data in the pipeline (offline and online). There should also be some basic intuition behind the factors that influences signalling states. Therefore, 

## Roadmap

1. **Support Multi-Tenancy**
   - Enable multi-tenancy for the application databases.

2. **Integration with an AI-driven human activity recognition system**
   - As per the section above. 

3. **Nurse User Feature Set**
   - Complete the nurse user feature set.

4. **Theming Update**
   - Update theming to match the Caretaker profile color palette (darker blue, flat icons).

5. **Google Sign-In Integration**
   - Integrate backend with Google Sign-In (enable in Firebase Authentication service).

6. **Database Integration**
   - Integrate database with heart rate data.
   - Integrate database with the patient archive list.
   - Integrate database with the nurse task list, allowing nurses to be assigned tasks by admins.

7. **Self-Hosted Backend Connection**
   - Allow application users to optionally connect to a self-hosted backend within the app.

8. **Security Implementation**
   - Implement documented security recommendations.

## Open Issues

See [Trello Backlog](https://trello.com/b/jszQMoj0/major-product-1-guardian-monitor)

## Lessons Learned

This trimester the Guardian team faced delays whilst being unable to gain access to the Firebase Admin console.
In future, project teams should:

1. Request Firebase access early to ensure there are no delays that would limit backend work.
2. Continue investigating self-hosted backend options which are compatible with Firebase.
3. Ensure that contributions Guardian, regardless of their focus, store all their documentation in the same  

## Product Development Life Cycle

1. Use a simple branching strategy where a branch is raised for each task and a pull request is raised back to the master branch.
2. PRs should be reviewed by a team leader who is experienced in the area of development. Feedback should be given for improvements and applied.
3. Once approved by a reviewer, the PR can be merged if the CI run passes and there's no conflicts.

## New Tasks

Tasks can be created on the trello board by any team member.
Team member's are encouraged to create new tasks if they find bugs to be fixed, or have ideas for improvements.

## Definition of Done

When it is reviewed and tested. It must fulfill the specification of the Trello task. 

In terms of the AI system 

## Task Review

Completed tasks will be reviewed by the project lead, or another member experienced with the task's domain. 

In terms of reviewing tasks related to the AI pipeline, it is often unclear whether a component is sufficient or 'complete' before it is integrated with the subsequent components. Therefore, after an internal review, an AI consultant will need to verify 
the integrity of the a task or component. If the tasks are code oriented, members must provide clear comments. 

## Testing

1. Unit tests to validate the functionality of pure Kotlin and Java code (not Android specific)
2. Instrumented UI tests to validate UI behaviour
3. Manual tests
4. In terms of the AI development, quoting a high evaluation metric does not justify a prototype model 'passing the test'. Members must verify with peers to make sure that generalisation considerations are not missed. 

## Branching Strategy

A simple workflow is followed where tasks are completed in each developer's project fork.
After that a PR is raised to merge changes into the master branch of the primary Guardian repository.
